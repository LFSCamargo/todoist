A simple flutter experience made in one day using flutter

## Getting Started

If you use the VSCode flutter extension you simply press play and will popup your simulator and run the project for you, if you dont use it just simply run those commands:

1 - `flutter packages get`
2 - `flutter build ios`

To get started with the project read the flutter docs there you will find how to run the project how to install deps and how to build into your device

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
